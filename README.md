### A real-time use case of Forecasting Sales Insights using AIMS Grid and Visualization tools.

>* ### **Abstract**
In this work, we leverage real-time sales data and business analytics to create company value by understanding customer intent (sentiment analysis). The whole work is partitioned into three: A prediction model that brings out insights on analysing the data using exploratory data analysis and seaborn plots visualization; An SQL query-based analysis is performed which produced data for the ETL Phase and the data is visualized to bring the conclusions; A project management and strategy planning tool is used to understand the stakeholders, success criteria, purposes and benefits and end results in a 4D grid view. 
The data was gathered from a variety of Walmart databases as well as a hardware firm. The analysis is done based on the correlation, multi-line plots and bar plots. Further, the AIMS Grid is designed for the same to understand and plan the strategies had before. Then, the data is visualized using a well-known business intelligence tool, TABLEAU to visualize the results better than data understandings.
