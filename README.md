### A real-time use case of Forecasting Sales Insights using AIMS Grid and Visualization tools.

>* ### **Abstract**
In this work, we leverage real-time sales data and business analytics to create company value by understanding customer intent (sentiment analysis). The whole work is partitioned into three: A prediction model that brings out insights on analysing the data using exploratory data analysis and seaborn plots visualization; An SQL query-based analysis is performed which produced data for the ETL Phase and the data is visualized to bring the conclusions; A project management and strategy planning tool is used to understand the stakeholders, success criteria, purposes and benefits and end results in a 4D grid view. 
The data was gathered from a variety of Walmart databases as well as a hardware firm. The analysis is done based on the correlation, multi-line plots and bar plots. Further, the AIMS Grid is designed for the same to understand and plan the strategies had before. Then, the data is visualized using a well-known business intelligence tool, TABLEAU to visualize the results better than data understandings. 


>* ### **Methodology**
As a part of AIMS grid project management tool, milestones to accomplish, Target audience/Stakeholders, Success Criteria, Purpose and End results are identified and are noted in a 4-grid plane. These are the main dimensions that shows interdependencies and shows relevant goal parameters which saves a lot of time.
In the next stage, a forecasting model is implemented to draw insights of sales from the analysis on the database used, performed Exploratory Data Analysis, drawn results with various evaluation metrices like accuracy, precision, confusion matrix and the variance between the data is found using correlation analysis. The results obtained were adequate and the redundant values are not considered. 
In the final stage, data analysis is done using SQL (on the previously collected data) which is termed as OLTP and is then used to perform ETL phase for the data warehouse (OLAP). The data is then visualized using TABLEAU dashboards to draw the prophetic conclusions and can visualize data rather storing in the text formats.
